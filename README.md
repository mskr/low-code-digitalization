Contribution for everyone

Tools for software development with people who code and people who do not code. 

This is not only for teams or companies, but for societies. 

Let's develop tools that are self-modifiable. That means, that their source code can (requested to) be changed via their own graphical interface.

Generic code is not written by "very smart" coders, but evolves through many contributors and is measurably verified by its number of users.

Generate docs and tickets from code comments - and code comments from docs and tickets.
